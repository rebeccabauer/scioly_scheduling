# Scioly Scheduling
This project schedules science olympiad practices. 
* To generate schedules, set the input and output locations in [main.py](./main.py) and run it.  
* You can adjust things like conflict penalties, priority bonuses, and the number of schedules to return in [the constants file](./scheduling/constants.py).
